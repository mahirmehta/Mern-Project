#TITLE:

Video Streaming Platform

#PROBLEM STATEMENT:

This project is to create a video streaming platform in which user can upload and watch videos 


#MOTIVATION:

The main purpose of using MERN stack is to develop apps using JavaScript only. This is because the four technologies that make up the technology stack are all JS-based. Thus, if one knows JavaScript (and JSON), the backend, frontend, and database can be operated easily.

Mostly start-up companies wants a fast developer as they want to speed up the production ,so they usually require the mern developer.
